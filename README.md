# Nodejs Scripts for the Nexus Repository API

## About
This is a toolbox for scripts that can be used consume Nexus Repository's (NXRM's) REST API. 
All scripts are written in Nodejs.

## Requirements
You need npm and Node installed on your local machine before you go any further!

## Purpose
I'm using this to provision NXRM for demo purposes, and to practice -- feverishly -- so that I 
can acquire ["the glow"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CkrEpYmBIQ).

See you later!
